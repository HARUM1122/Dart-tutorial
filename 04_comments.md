## Comments in dart

In dart, `comments` are the statements that are completely ignored by the dart compiler and doesn't get executed.  The basic use of `comments` is to help others to understand our code.  In dart, there are two types of comments: 
- Single line comments.
- Multi line comments.

We use single line comments when we write a comment in a single line. For writing a comment in multiple lines, we use multi-line comments.

Here's an example of comments in dart
```dart
void main() {
   // This is a single line comment
   /* This is a comment
    On multiple
    Lines. */
}
```
