## What is programming?
Programming is like giving instructions to the computer to make it do what you want. It's like telling a very literal and an obedient friend who only understands a programming langauge. This language is called `A programming language`. In programming, you write the set of instructions called `code` that a computer follows step by step. Imagine telling a computer to make a sandwich. For that, you need to specify every action like taking bread, adding toppings, and putting it all together. Similarly, in programming, you specify each action to solve a problem. That problem can be, calculating a sum of numbers, fetching a friend list etc. There are many different kinds of programming languages, and each language has its own use cases. For instance, Python is mostly used in data science, Machine learning etc. Dart is mostly used in making cross-platform applications. Java script is mostly used in web development.


## What is dart?
Dart is a modern, open source, and client optimized programming language developed by Google. It is designed for building fast, scalable, and maintainable applications. With a focus on front-end development, server-side scripting, and mobile app development. Dart is known for its simplicity, readability, and performance. It has a `C-Style Syntax`. Dart is a fully object-oriented programming language which means everything in dart is an object. It supports classes, and objects which helps in organizing the code. Dart is a `type-safe` language. Which basically means it helps catch, and deter certain kinds of mistakes related to data types.
