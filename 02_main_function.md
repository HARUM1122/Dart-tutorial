## Main function in dart

In dart programming language, `main` function is the starting point of the execution. Which means when you run a dart program, the dart runtime system starts executing the dart code from the `main` function. Every dart program must have a `main` function. 
Here's how a main function looks like.
```dart
void main() {
    // Your code here
}
```

Let's understand this code in detail.
- void: Void is a return type in dart programming language. It indicates that a function doesn't return any data.
- main: It is the name of the function. You can't use a different name for this function. Its name should be `main`
- {}: Curly brackets define the body of the main function. Here you write the code that you want to be executed when the program starts.
